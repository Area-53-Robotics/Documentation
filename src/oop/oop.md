# Object Oriented Programming

Simply put, object oriented programming is a way of organizing your code. It allows you to assiciate functions and variables with groups called objects. 

Objects are defined from classes. A class is like a blueprint. Imagine we have a class called Car. Car has properties, which are: color, speed, wheel_size. It might also have methods, like drive() and brake(). If we define a new car based on the Car class, it will have those properties and methods.

> Note: Astute readers will notive that the capitalizations in the paragraph above are weird. This is because we always capitalize class names, but we never capitalize objects.

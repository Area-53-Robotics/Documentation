# Area 53 Robotics

This is the **ultimate** guide to programming for VEX robotics.

The goal of this documentation is to provide a resource for programmers to get started, even if they no prior experience.

This guides covers everything from the basics of C++, to the basics of the different APIs, to quality of life tools like git, and clang-format, to naming conventions, to high level concepts like PID and odometry.

The guide goes in chronological order, so later chapters assume you know what was covered in the earlier ones.

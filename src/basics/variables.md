# Variables
Variables are names associated with values. Different variables are specified by their name so other programmers can easily identify what the variable is for and what type of value it is associated.

# Data Types:

Data types are used to categorize values that a variable is associated with. Bob wants to learn how to use data types below.

Integer (Int)

- The integer data type classifies variables as whole numbers.

```cpp
int age;
```

Bob wants to know how old he will be next year. The declared variable used the data type `int` because Bob's age can only be an integer.

Float (float)

- The float data type classifies variables as decimals.

```cpp
float gpa;
```

Bob is checking what his GPA is for second semester. The declared variable used the data type `float` because Bob's GPA will vary from a whole number or a decimal depending on his performance.

Character (char)

- The character data type classifies variables as letters.

```cpp
char math_grade;
```

Bob completed a math test yesterday and is preparing to see how he did. The declared variable used the data type `char` because Bob's score will be categorized by A, B, C, D, or E.

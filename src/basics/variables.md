# Variables
Variables are names associated with values. Different variables are specified by their name so other programmers can easily identify what the variable is for and what type of value it is associated.

# Data Types

Data types are used to categorize values that a variable is associated with.

Integer (Int)

- The integer data type classifies variables as whole numbers.

```cpp
int age;
```

Age would be classified as a `int` because age is always a whole number.

Float (float)

- The float data type classifies variables as decimals.

```cpp
float gpa;
```

GPA would be classified as a `float` because your GPA can vary between a whole number and a decimal.

Character (char)

- The character data type classifies variables as letters.

```cpp
char grade;
```

Your grade would be best classified as a `char` because letters are typically used to categorize them.

String (string)

- The string data type classifies variables as words, phrases, or sentences.

```cpp
std::string greeting = "Hello world!";
```

> Note: The string data type requires the std namespace ([explained here](basics/namespaces.md)) to function, unlike other data types.

A greeting would be classified as a `string` because greetings are conveyed with words.

Boolean (bool)

- The boolean data type classifies variables as either true (0) or false (1).

```cpp
bool lightbulb;
```

A lightbulb would be classified as a `bool` because lights can either be on or off, which is two choices.

# Advanced Data Types

Certain data types vary based on the size of the value.

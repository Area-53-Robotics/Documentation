# Area 53 Robotics

This is the **ultimate** guide to programming for VEX robotics.

The goal of this documentation is to provide a resource for programmers to get started, even if they no prior experience.

The first section of this guide (the one you're in right now) is focused on non-technical aspects of being a VEX programmer, including information on the year's competition game as well as the intangibles of being a programmer.

^^Continue in this format below

This guides covers everything from the basics of C++, to the basics of the different APIs, to quality of life tools like git, and clang-format, to naming conventions, to high level concepts like PID and odometry.

The guide goes in chronological order, so later chapters assume you know what was covered in the earlier ones. If you're new to programming, we highly recommend you go through the sections in order, but if you're looking for specific examples, feel free to go straight to the examples section.

^^ Too clunky?

Felix Hass - Believes that rust is definitely better than C++.

Isaiah Blanc - Is mad that Felix spelled "definitely" wrong.

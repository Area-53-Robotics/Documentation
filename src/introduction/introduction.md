# Area 53 Robotics

This is the **ultimate** guide to programming for VEX robotics.

The goal of this guide is to provide a resource for programmers to get started, even if they no prior experience. It does not aim to be a replacement to the official documentation for the things covered, it just attemts to introduce new programmer to these concepts. 

The first section of this guide (the one you're in right now) is focused on non-technical aspects of being a VEX programmer, including information on the year's competition game as well as the intangibles of being a programmer.

This guides covers everything from the basics of C++, to the basics of the different APIs, to quality of life tools like git, and clang-format, to naming conventions, to high level concepts like PID and odometry.

The guide goes in chronological order, so later chapters assume you know what was covered in the earlier ones. If you're new to programming, we highly recommend you go through the sections in order, but if you're looking for specific examples, feel free to go straight to the examples section.
